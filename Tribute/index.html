The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India. 

 

The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region.

It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.
